One major benefit of moving to frameworks like React or Vue is the ability to build dynamic and responsive web applications more efficiently. 
These frameworks allow developers to break down the UI into reusable components, which makes the codebase cleaner and easier to manage. 
With built-in tools like state management and lifecycle methods, React and Vue help in handling complex application logic more effectively. 
They also improve performance by updating only the parts of the DOM that change, thanks to features like the virtual DOM. 
Developers can benefit from a more structured and modular development process, reducing the chances of bugs and improving scalability. 
These frameworks also come with large ecosystems and community support, offering libraries and plugins for almost any use case. 
React’s JSX and Vue’s template syntax allow for writing clear and readable code that combines HTML and JavaScript logic seamlessly. 
Both frameworks support integration with backend services and APIs, making them ideal for modern full-stack development.
